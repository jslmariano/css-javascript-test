# Noni Front End Developer Coding Challenge

## OBJECTIVE

You are going to create a simple news page application. It will pull new articles from an API and display them. Use your creativity and design skills to make the page your own. Be sure to make the page responsive as well.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### PART 1: CSS

Using CSS properties alone, recreate the button on the page. DO NOT change the html to acheive the desired look, only CSS.

### PART 2: Javascript

Connect to the provided API and pull the news articles with a GET request.

After you have been able to pull and display the data, add three JavaScript based features.

1.  Add the ability to filter the news articles from the API by title from an input box

2.  Display an error message if nothing is found matching the search criteria

3.  Add pagination to iterate the list of news articles youâ€™ve displayed. Show only 5 articles at a time

Be sure to style your creation as magnificently as you can.

**\*NOTE:** You are open to change the file structure to complete the JavaScript part of the challenge. Do whatever you are comfortable with\*

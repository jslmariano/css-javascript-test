    PART 2: Javascript

    Use any technologies that you are comfortable with such as use Vue, React, or Angular, Bootstrap etc. Feel free to spend as much or as little time as you’d like.
    After you have been able to pull and display the data, add three javascript based features.

    1. Add the ability to filter the news articles from the api by title from an input box

    2. Display an error message if nothing is found matching the search criteria

    3. Add pagination to iterate the list of news articles you’ve displayed. Show only 5 articles at a time

    API Endpoint: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=9e56665dd12747d699700625112fe619

    NOTE: You are open to change the file structure to complete the JavaScript part of the challenge. Do whatever you are comforable with
